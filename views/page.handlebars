                                <p>Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. If
                                    one of your blood vessels gets damaged, it sends out signals that are picked up by
                                    platelets. The platelets then rush to the site of damage and form a plug, or clot,
                                    to repair the damage.</p>
                                <p>The process of spreading across the surface of a damaged blood vessel to stop
                                    bleeding is called adhesion. This is because when platelets get to the site of the
                                    injury, they grow sticky tentacles that help them adhere. They also send out
                                    chemical signals to attract more platelets to pile onto the clot in a process called
                                    aggregation.</p>
                                <p>Platelets are made in your bone marrow along with your white and red blood cells.
                                    Your bone marrow is the spongy center inside your bones. Another name for platelets
                                    is thrombocytes. Healthcare providers&nbsp;usually call a clot a thrombus. Once
                                    platelets are made and circulated into your bloodstream, they live for 8 to 10 days.
                                </p>
                                <p>Under a microscope, a platelet looks like a tiny plate. Your&nbsp;healthcare
                                    provider&nbsp;may do a blood test called a complete blood count to find out if your
                                    bone marrow is making the right number of platelets:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>A normal platelet count is 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of
                                            blood.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Risk for spontaneous bleeding develops if a platelet count falls below 10,000
                                            to 20,000. But when the platelet count is less than 50,000, bleeding is
                                            likely to be more serious if an individual is cut or bruised.&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p>Some people make too many platelets and can have platelet counts from 500,000
                                            to more than 1 million.</p>

                                    counts:&nbsp;</p>
                                <ul>

                                        <p><strong>Thrombocytopenia.&nbsp;</strong>In this condition, your bone marrow
                                            makes too few platelets, or your platelets are destroyed. If your platelet
                                            count gets too low, bleeding can occur under the skin as bruising, inside
                                            the body as internal bleeding, or outside the body through a cut that won't
                                            stop bleeding or from a nosebleed. Thrombocytopenia can be caused by many
                                            conditions, including several medicines, cancer, kidney disease, pregnancy,
                                            infections, and an abnormal immune system.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Thrombocythemia.</strong>&nbsp;In this condition, your bone marrow
                                            makes too many platelets. People with thrombocythemia may have platelet
                                            counts that exceed 1 million. Symptoms can include blood clots that form and
                                            block blood supply to the brain or the heart. The cause of thrombocythemia
                                            is unknown.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p><strong>Thrombocytosis.&nbsp;</strong>This is another condition caused by too
                                            many platelets, but platelet counts do not get as high as in
                                            thrombocythemia. Thrombocytosis is more common and is not caused by abnormal
                                            bone marrow. Instead, the cause is another disease or condition in the body
                                            that stimulates the bone marrow to make more platelets. Causes include
                                            infection, inflammation, some types of cancer, and reactions to medicines.
                                            Symptoms are usually not serious, and the platelet count goes back to normal
                                            when the underlying condition gets better.</p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p><strong>Platelet dysfunction.&nbsp;</strong>There are many rare diseases
                                            associated with poor platelet function, when the number of platelets is
                                            normal, but the platelets do not work normally. Some medicines, such as
                                            aspirin, can inhibit normal platelet function. It is important to know which
                                            medicines affect platelet function and to appreciate that while taking these
                                            medicines there is an increased risk of bleeding.&nbsp;</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    Platelets are tiny but important cells in your blood that help your body control
                                    bleeding. If you have symptoms such as easy bruising, a cut that keeps bleeding, or
                                    frequent nosebleeds, let your&nbsp;healthcare provider&nbsp;know. A simple blood
                                    test is all you need to find out if your platelet count is normal.&nbsp;</p>
